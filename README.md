# AureliaAspNetCoreAuth

This single page application is an example of token based authentication implementation using the Aurelia front end framework and ASP.NET core.

It uses OpenId to generate tokens after a successful login.

The Token is then used to connect to a SignalR persistent connection, therefore establishing an authenticated real-time connection. The status of the user is broadcasted and if another client connects, it is communicated to all the online clients.

## Limitations
* There is no database implementation, this project is supposed to be used as a boiler plate for you to build on top of using the database technology you find the most suitable for your application.
* There is no refresh token logic.
