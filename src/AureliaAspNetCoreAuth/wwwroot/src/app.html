<!--Following our simple app-building convention, the App class will be databound to the above view in app.html. 
    A large part of this markup deals with setting up the main navigation structure. 
    But before we get into that...do you see the require elements at the top of the view? 
    In the same way that you can use import statements in ES2015/2016, Aurelia enables you to use require elements in HTML. 
    The require element enables loading and including of functionality such as custom elements and behaviors, 
    and in this case, CSS. Here, since our sample app is going to use some bootstrap styles and icons from font-awesome, 
    we "require" those style sheets. With that in place, we can use bootstrap to lay out our navigation structure, as above.
    But that's not the interesting part of this view. What we really want to focus on is the binding and custom elements...

Since you've seen basic binding and string interpolation already, let's focus on the new stuff. 
    Take a look at the navbar-nav ul element. Its li demonstrates how to use a repeater with the following 
    expression repeat.for="row of router.navigation". This will create one li for each item in the router.navigation array. 
    The local variable is row and you can see that used throughout the li and its child elements.-->

<template>
    <require from="bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css"></require>
    <require from="font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css"></require>
    <require from='./nav-bar'></require>

    <nav-bar router.bind="router"></nav-bar>

    <div class="page-host">
        <router-view></router-view>
    </div>
